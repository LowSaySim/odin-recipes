    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Hainan Chicken Rice is a classic dish beloved by people in Singapore and
      all over Asia. Served room temperature, the chicken is incredibly silky.
      But the rice is really the star—cooked in the broth from poaching the
      chicken, served with a trio of condiments.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 whole chicken (about 3-4 pounds)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>5 slices ginger</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
      <li>2 stalks green onions</li>
      <li>4 cups jasmine rice</li>
      <li>4 cups chicken broth (from poaching the chicken)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Clean the chicken by rubbing it with salt and rinsing it under cold
        water. This helps to remove any impurities and gives the skin a nice
        texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, bring enough water to cover the chicken to a boil. Add
        ginger, garlic, and green onions to the water. Submerge the chicken in
        the boiling water, breast side down. Reduce heat to low and simmer for
        about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the chicken is cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the chicken is cooking, rinse the jasmine rice under cold water
        until the water runs clear. Drain well.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pan, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic
        and ginger, sautéing until fragrant. Add the rinsed rice and stir to
        coat each grain with the oil and aromatics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 4 cups of the chicken broth (from poaching) to the rice. Bring to a
        boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or
        until the rice is cooked and fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot and let it rest for a
        few minutes. You can optionally rub it with sesame oil for extra flavor.
        Chop into serving pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the chicken on a plate alongside a mound of fragrant rice. Garnish
        with cucumber slices and fresh cilantro if desired. Serve with dipping
        sauces such as chili sauce, ginger sauce, and soy sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
