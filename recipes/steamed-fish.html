    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 whole fish (about 1.5 pounds) or 2 fish fillets (about 6 ounces each)
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fermented black beans, rinsed and chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger, julienned</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon rice wine or dry sherry</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 stalks green onions, sliced</li>
      <li>Fresh cilantro for garnish (optional)</li>
      <li>Steamed white rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If using a whole fish, clean and scale the fish, then make three
        diagonal cuts on each side. If using fillets, pat them dry with paper
        towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the fish on a heatproof plate that fits inside your steamer. If
        you don't have a steamer, you can use a large pot with a steaming rack
        or a metal colander.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, mix together the fermented black beans, garlic, ginger,
        soy sauce, rice wine, and sugar. Spoon the mixture over the fish, making
        sure to get some into the cuts if using a whole fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up your steamer and bring the water to a boil. Place the plate with
        the fish in the steamer, cover, and steam for about 8-10 minutes
        (fillets) or 12-15 minutes (whole fish), or until the fish is opaque and
        flakes easily with a fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the fish is steaming, heat the vegetable oil in a small pan over
        medium heat until it starts to shimmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the fish is done, carefully remove it from the steamer. Pour the
        hot oil over the fish to sizzle the aromatics. Garnish with sliced green
        onions and fresh cilantro if desired.
      </li>
      <li>Serve immediately with steamed white rice.</li>
    </ol>
